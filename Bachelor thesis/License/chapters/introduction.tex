One of my favourite courses in the faculty was Functional Programming. It made me see computer science from a different point of view and develop my critical and analytical thinking. For these reasons, I found the idea of making my bachelor thesis on a subject related to this course interesting. \\
\indent The subject of the thesis is verifying that a F* implementation of the Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm is correct. The thesis is divided into \(3\) parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm - this chapter describes the way the algorithm works, what problem it solves and what is the output data;
\item The F* language - here I describe the programming language I used for my thesis, the motivation of choosing it and the particular components that were useful;
\item The proof for the Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm - this part describes the solution I implemented and the steps I made.
\end{enumerate}
